# ArPirobot Framework

The ArPiRobot Framework is a collection of programs, libraries, and tools to build robots using a Single Board Computer (eg a Raspberry Pi) and a microcontroller development board (eg an Arduino). The framework includes several tools to simplify the development process and eliminate the need for familiarity with configuring and interfacing with Single Board Computers. The goal is to make building a robot easy regardless of technical background.
